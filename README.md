# NFrenT - Why let your NFTs sit idle? Rent 'em
## The Problem
Market of inactive NFT Holders
-> Satiated by the utilities that the NFT provides
  - stoner cats - once the show is watched
  - BAYC - no interest anymore
  - don't want to actively manage NFT positions - Uni v3
-> Want to jump into newer exciting NFTs while not loosing ownership of the current ones
-> Simply earn some bucks on NFTs that sit idly in the portfolio

                                MATCH with теп

Market of admirers of the same NFTs, communitiesor to use the positions to gain the fees

## The Time Bound Tokens
### a token that makes it possible to transfer and manage ownership of the timeline of an asset
Time bounded assets like
- for subscription based services => avail specific services during the subscription period
- time-limited voting/gov => can enable special abilities during a specific time interval
- time dependent access/rewards => can be used for contributors based on engagement in the community of a protocol which enables them with elite powers
- renting RWAs
- escrow positions => acting as intermediaries, secure assets until predefined conditions are met

Designed as a utility token
The owner of the TBT has the right to utilize the underlying asset for some economic benefit via calling the utility function
Ownership of the token is determined by checking if present time is part of the claim of the timeline by the user.

Example of these benefits could be the following:
- Minting new Axie infinity breeds with the wrapped Axies.
- Collecting fees with the wrapped Uniswap liquidity position.
- Calling a governance related function.
- Swapping between USDC and ETH following a constant sum formula (options).
- Representing renting of real estates.
- Recurring Payments

## Rent Them

The platform enables users to rent their NFTs, with the help of TBTs, that would otherwise do nothing sitting in the portfolio
because users genrally keep on having attention shift from one NFT hype project to other OR have already used up the privilages that come with the NFTs

## Future scope

The Time-bound tokens come with game changing ideas when it comes to time limited phenomenons.
- creating automated market makers (AMMs) -> allowing the swapping of TBT tokens between different timelines or trading present and future tokens
- in the ever growing gaming industry -> enabling game guilds to rent out their NFTs to players in exchange for earning game rewards
- escrow positions -> acting as intermediaries, secure assets until predefined conditions are met
